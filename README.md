# Glassy-disorder-in-QPEA
Primary codes to obtain the behaviour of the algorithm, in particular, the dependence of quenched average probabilities on disorder, in the presence of glassy disorder in noisy Hadamard gates. See arXiv:2112.04411 [quant-ph] for details.
The data and code to reproduce the plots of the paper are provided in the folder named 'Plots'.
Some figures will not match with that of the current version1 of the paper. Corresponding updated version2 of the paper is expected by mid-March 2022.
